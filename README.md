This repository contains two folders each one of which is an iOS project written in Swift 5 and built in xcode 12.0.
They are intended to be 'sample' code for a swift programming portfolio.
 
ByteCoin is a project completed during the attendance of the 'Complete iOS App Development BootCamp' Online Course. 
It is a simple app which makes a web API call, gets the current Bitcoin price and displays it on screen in the currency the user chooses.

ChessClock folder, as the name implies, contains a chess clock :-). Being a chess and technology enthusiast at the same time, I tried to make 
my own version of a functional chess clock. So each player taps his/her side whenever he/she make a move.
